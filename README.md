## AI ChatBot Project (Private AI options)

- Please watch: [Video about Guild Project](https://wnccnet-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/loringw_wncc_edu/EQc3SGTfIatAkoM0KrAEeMcBv-unJKhR9tElYD93-XLvCA?e=ixGNOO) (10-16-25)

Python Flask project to create a web chatbot. Private mode: host an open-source model yourself (local server, private cloud, or on-prem) for full control over data and privacy.

## Project Outline: Flask Chatbot (Private AI)

## 1. Project Goal 🎯

Build a reliable web chatbot. The app should let users exchange messages with an AI model and see streamed responses.

- Privacy-first solution running a private model server (containerized) with secure access and logging controls.

## 2. Key Technologies

- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Waitress (chat endpoint and API connector)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 
- **Private AI**: local model server (lightweight runtime like llama.cpp / GGML for CPU quantized models)

## 3. Architecture & Implementation Plan

High level: Client (browser) -> Flask app -> (Private model server) -> Flask -> browser.

The implementation is split into phases so the team can ship incrementally.

## Phase 1: Setup Flask Server & Ollama Backend

### ✅ Install ollama on Windows 2025 Server

1. Download the latest [Ollama Release](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/releases) (e.g., ollama-windows-amd64.zip)
2. Extract the zip file --> place all files in c:\ollama
3. Add to system environment variables: c:\ollama
4. Verify installation: Open a Command Prompt:
5. Verify that the test model on the server is Gemma3:4b

   ```ollama --version```

5. Pull a Model to test with:
  
    ```ollama pull llama3.1```

### ✅ Set Up Ollama as a Windows Service (using NSSM)

This ensures Ollama starts automatically with the server and restarts if it ever crashes, without requiring a user to be logged in.

Step 1: Download NSSM

1. Go to the [NSSM download page](https://nssm.cc/download).
2. Download the latest release (e.g., nssm-2.24.zip).
3. Extract the ZIP file to a permanent location on your server, like C:\nssm

Step 2: Configure the Ollama Service with NSSM

1. Open an Administrator Command Prompt or Administrator PowerShell.

   ```nssm install Ollama```

This will open the NSSM service installer GUI.

Application Tab:

1. Path: Click the ... button and navigate to your ollama.exe file.
2. Startup directory: This should automatically populate to the correct folder.
3. Arguments: This is the most important part. Enter:

   ```serve```
  
This tells Ollama to run as a server.

4. Log on Tab: For a server, it's best to run this as a Local System account. Select the

 ```Local System account```

 radio button. This allows the service to run even when no user is logged in.
 
 5. Environment Tab: This is critical for allowing your Flask server to access Ollama.
 6. In the Environment variables box, add the following key-value pair:

   ```OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0```

  This tells Ollama to listen for requests on all network interfaces, not just localhost.

  7. Click the ```Install service``` button. You should see a "Service 'Ollama' installed successfully!" message.

Step 3: Start the Service

1. Open the Windows Services app (run services.msc).
2. Find your new service named Ollama.
3. Right-click it and select Start.
4. Verify it's working: Open your server's web browser and navigate to:
  
   ```http://localhost:11434```

5. You should see the message "Ollama is running."

The Ollama server is now running as a persistent service on port 11434, accessible from other machines on your network.

☐ Todo — Draft README
🔄 In progress — Add examples and docs
✅ Complete — Initial release

## Flask Web Server

🔄 In progress

- Create `main_app.py` with routes for the homepage (`/`) and chat (`/chat`).
- Build `index.html` with a chat history, input, and send button.
- Implement minimal CSS to make the UI usable.
- Create virtual environment
  - Install python ollama library:

     ```pip install ollama```

## Phase 2: Frontend-Backend Communication

☐ Todo

- Use `main.js` to send user messages to `/chat` and append both user and bot messages to the DOM.

## Phase 3 — Private AI Integration (self-hosted)

☐ Todo

- CPU-only machines: prefer quantized models (GGML / llama.cpp) or small transformer models.
- Create a model server and expose an internal HTTP endpoint.
- Secure the private server: mTLS / API key, and run behind an IIS server which runs waitress
- Add support for streaming responses if the model server supports it.

## Phase 4 — Privacy, Logging & Data Handling

☐ Todo

- Decide what to log (timestamps, anonymized session id, message length). Avoid storing PII by default.
- Add a user-facing privacy notice and an opt-out for logging.
- Implement retention policy and a script to sweep/delete logs older than X days.

## Phase 5 — Deploy & Ops

☐ Todo

- Add health checks, simple metrics (request counts, success/failure), and basic monitoring instructions.

### 4. Task Breakdown

This plan maps team roles to implement the privacy-oriented private mode.

#### Frontend (UI/UX)

- Team 1 (HTML & Structure): `index.html` — chat layout, message list, input form.
- Team 2 (CSS & Interactivity): `style.css` and `main.js` — chat bubbles, responsive layout, DOM updates, optimistic UI.

Shared goal: Deliver a clean, usable chat UI with graceful error states.

#### Backend (Flask Core)

- Team 3 (Server & Routing): `app.py` — create routes, session handling, simple persistence for sessions.
- Team 4 (Request & Response Handling): Implement `/chat` logic that validates input, forwards to the connector, and returns JSON or streaming responses.

Shared goal: Reliable, well-documented endpoints and simple persistence for conversation history.

#### AI Integration & Ops

- Team 5 (Private AI & Security): Implement local/private model server wiring and implement logging & retention rules. If hardware allows, tune for streaming and lower-latency inference.

Optional extras for the team:

- Add unit/integration tests for the connector code.
- Add a small evaluation page that replays test prompts and shows model outputs side-by-side.
- Add simple cost/latency telemetry so the team can compare different models.

---

Notes and safety:

- For private hosting, pick a model size that fits your hardware. Quantized CPU models are great for demos and privacy.
- Make privacy decisions explicit in the app UI (logging on/off, data retention).

**Shared Goal**: Create an intuitive and attractive user interface.

#### **Team 2: The Backend Team (Flask Core)** ⚙️

This pair builds the server-side foundation of the application.

- **Team 3 (Server & Routing)**: Set up the `app.py` file, initialize the Flask application, and create the routes for the home page (`/`) and the chat endpoint (`/chat`).
- **Team 4 (Request & Response Handling)**: Implement the logic within the routes to handle incoming `POST` requests from the frontend. Manage the data flow, ensuring that user input is correctly received and that responses are sent back in the proper JSON format.

**Shared Goal**: Build a stable and reliable server that connects the frontend to the AI logic.

#### **Team 3: The AI Integration Team (API Connectors)** 🧠

This pair focuses on the "smart" part of the chatbot.

- **Team 5 (API Research & Logic)**: Research suitable conversational models on the Hugging Face Hub. Write the core Python function that takes a user's message, formats it correctly, and sends it to the Hugging Face Inference API.

## Project Ideas
